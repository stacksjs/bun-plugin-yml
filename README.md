# bun-plugin-yml

A simple loader for your yml & yaml files.

## Features

- Simple `.yml` & `.yaml` file loader
- Powered by js-yaml

## Usage

```bash
bun install -d bun-plugin-yml
```

Next, ensure you are preloading the plugin in your `bunfig.toml`:

```toml
preload = [
  "./node_modules/bun-plugin-yml/src/index.ts",
  # ...
]
```

You may now use it in your project:

```ts
import config from './config/settings.yml'

// Example usage of loaded YAML content
console.log(`Application Name: ${config.appName}`)
console.log(`Version: ${config.version}`)
```
